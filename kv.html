    <h2>Answers to Git Control Questions</h2>

    <h3>What is a Version Control System?</h3>
    <p>A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool designed to track changes in code and project files, allowing you to revert to previous versions, monitor the history of changes, and collaboratively work on projects.</p>

    <h3>What type of VCS is Git? What's its main difference from other types?</h3>
    <p>Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). The main difference between DVCS and centralized systems is that every repository copy is complete and contains the entire history of changes, allowing work independently from a central server.</p>

    <h3>What are the advantages of using Git?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reliability and high performance.</li>
        <li>Ability to work offline, as repositories are fully local.</li>
        <li>Flexible and easy branching and merging.</li>
        <li>Effective teamwork and support for distributed teams.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Which Git commands do you know?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>git init</code> – initialize a new repository.</li>
        <li><code>git clone</code> – clone an existing repository.</li>
        <li><code>git add</code> – add files to staging.</li>
        <li><code>git commit</code> – commit (record changes).</li>
        <li><code>git push</code> – push changes to a remote repository.</li>
        <li><code>git pull</code> – fetch changes from a remote repository.</li>
        <li><code>git status</code> – check the status of the current repository.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is the difference between Git and GitHub?</h3>
    <p><strong>Git</strong> is a version control system for managing project history and changes. <strong>GitHub</strong> is a web-based platform providing cloud storage for Git repositories, enabling developers to collaboratively work on projects online.</p>
